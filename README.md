# Tenda
Tenda is a small app to manage your personal finances in a opinionated way. The idea is that you have a rolling total every day and you should be able to match that against the total in your bank account, but then still have the ability to see future plan expenses and how much money you will have at that time also. 

It also provides a convenient way to keep track of what bills are still outstanding, when you are trying to manage the various different ways companies bill today.
